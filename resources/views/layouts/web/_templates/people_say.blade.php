                        <p>Great quality for the price! They not only fit my two year old but would also fit an adult in a pinch. I know they will work for my kid for may years to come. They block out loud noise but not so much that you cannot hear anything. Buy these of you are considering it, they are well worth the price!</p>

                        <p>My 7 month old daughter came to a concert with us and was able to sleep through part of it with her headphones on. She did not mind them at all. She normally starts crying if the noise is too loud. I am excited to be able to use these for fireworks and other loud events!</p>

                        <p> I would recommend this product to anyone with young kids in a loud situation. We used them for my 6 month old daughter at a baseball game and she was able to fall asleep and take a good nap with these on. GREAT PRODUCT!</p>
